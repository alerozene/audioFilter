# Filter Audio signals

## Program structure


## Resources and where I stand now 

In process of making the Qwidget application following partly the [first tutorial](https://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/creator-writing-program.html) for window creation and now stuck at browsing the file following [this post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5602798/how-to-launch-a-file-browser-in-a-qt-application). The stuck part was because I wasnt't rebuilding...

Then I added a plain text widget in the ui and set it to display the path

Next, create a new ui.h for the plot and access it from the button clicked function


## plot form
Add the form by typing...
